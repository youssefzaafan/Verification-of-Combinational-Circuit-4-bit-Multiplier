# UVM-Based Verification Project for a Multiplier Design

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** testbench developed to verify the functionality of a simple **4-bit multiplier** design. It includes structured SystemVerilog components such as driver, monitor, scoreboard, agent, environment, and a functional coverage collector using a subscriber class.

The goal of this project is to show strong understanding of UVM methodology, transaction-level modeling, constrained random stimulus generation, functional coverage, and self-checking verification environments.

ðŸ§  Design Under Test (DUT)

The DUT is a simple 4-bit multiplier that takes two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b` and produces an 8-bit output `c` 

---

ðŸ§ª Testbench Architecture

The testbench follows UVM methodology and includes the following components:

- transaction.sv: Defines the transaction class with randomizable fields `a`, `b` and calculated field `c`.
- generator.sv: Implements a sequence that generates random stimulus to be executed by the driver.
- driver.sv: Drives transactions to the DUT inputs.
- monitor.sv: Monitors DUT I/O and sends transactions to scoreboard and coverage.
- scoreboard.sv: Compares actual DUT output with expected output (`a * b`).
- subscriber.sv: Implements a coverage class using a covergroup with bins for input combinations.
- agent.sv: Encapsulates driver and monitor.
- env.sv: Instantiates the agent, scoreboard, subscriber, and connects the sequencer to the test.
- sequence.sv: Generates random stimuli using UVM sequences.
- test.sv: Top-level UVM test that starts sequences and reports results.
- TB.sv: Connects the DUT to the testbench and launches simulation.

âœ… Functional Coverage

Functional coverage is collected on the input values `a` and `b` using a **covergroup** inside the `subscriber` component. The coverage model tracks:

- All values of `a` from 0 to 15
- All values of `b` from 0 to 15

Coverage is reported in the `final_phase()` of the subscriber.
